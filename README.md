In the current state of the world during Corona virus pandemic ðŸ¦  and with many of us in lockdown, I thought it would be a good idea to put down Netflix for a bit, and build a COVID Dashboard with MAP showing statistics of increase of corona virus around the world. 

Hover over the countries to see additional details for each country in tooltips. Used the api from  https://corona.lmao.ninja/v2/jhucsse & https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2568274/SzS8rjbe?version=latest2 which returns a list of countries and provinces with COVID-19 stats. Then, mapped the data with the co-ordinates in the JSON to the map along with colour schemes and circle radius size based on the number. 

Feel free to use the code from the links provided below. My version is a very simple version and more functionality but it's up to you to include more features.
